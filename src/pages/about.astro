    <h1 class="title">About</h1>
    <p>
      I was born and raised in Toronto, Ontario. As a son to immigrant parents, I understand the
      value of hard work.
    </p>
    <p>
      I earned a Bachelor of Engineering from McMaster University, and worked in the Architecure,
      Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry for 5 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      In 2019 I quit my job and committed to learning software development full time. I attended the
      Next Academy Web Development Bootcamp in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Afterwards I backpacked
      through the region for some time. It was an unforgettable experience. Upon returning home I
      began my new life as a professional developer.
