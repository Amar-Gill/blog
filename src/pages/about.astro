		<h1 class="title">About</h1>
		<p>
			I grew up in Toronto, Ontario. Being born to immigrant parents, I understood the value of hard
			work. I earned a Civil Engineering and Management degree from McMaster University, and have
			over 4 years of experience in the Architecure, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry.
		</p>
		<p>
			My interest in programming led me to switch careers into software engineering in 2019. I quit
			my job as a consultant to attend a full-stack development bootcamp in Malaysia. After
			backpacking through the region for some time, I returned home to begin my new life as a
			professional developer.
