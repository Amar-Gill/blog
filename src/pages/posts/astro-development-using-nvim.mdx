#### TLDR
It's January 2023, and I have these configuration options and plug ins to use Neovim for developing with the Astro framework:
- `astro` LSP server, available in [nvim-lsp-config]() plugin and [mason]()
- [astro-treesitter-grammar]() for syntax highlighting of `.astro` files
- [this-plugin]() for syntax highlighting of `.mdx` files
- I use the document formatter provided by the Astro LSP, and *not* the [prettierd]() built in formatting source available in [`null-ls`]() plugin
  - continue reading to learn why, though this may change in the future

#### Basics
The bare minimum I require is an LSP server and syntax highlighting. This is supported well in Neovim through the [astro]() LSP available in [nvim-lsp-configs]() plug ins and [TreeSitter]() grammar for Astro.

#### Mdx Syntax Highlighting
After setting up the basics, I noticed `.mdx` files were not being highlighted at all, despite having the [markdown]() tree sitter grammar installed. I searched around and couldn't find a tree-sitter grammar for `.mdx` files, but there was a neovim plug in that I could install instead: [link-to-plugin]().

I'm really happy with this plugin so far. It provides correct syntax highlighting of frontmatter which is `yaml` for `mdx` files, and inline code blocks of most languages I write about.

#### Formatting
Consistent and fast formatting is non-negotiable for me. Being a JavaScript framework, many of the [astro templates]() I looked at had [prettier]() and [eslint]() configured. Great! My configuration is already working with React so Astro should not be too different.

After testing it out on a project, I noticed the formatter was not working. Running `:LspInfo` nvim command showed that `null-ls` server was not attached to the buffer.

Looking at the [prettierd]() default arguments, the `astro` filetype was not included. So I added it as an `extra_filetype`:

```lua
local null_ls = require("null-ls")
local formatting = null_ls.builtins.formatting

null_ls.setup({
  sources = {
    formatting.prettierd.with({
      extra_filetypes = { "astro" }
    })
  }
})
```

Now I was able to get the `null-ls` server attached to the `astro` buffer, but the formatting was still not happening.

After reading into the [vs-code-astro-plugin]() I learned that the formatting is included in the LSP itself.

So instead I need to update my LSP formatting handler to use both `null-ls` and `astro` LSP servers. Until now it had only been `null-ls`:

```lua
local lsp_formatting = function(bufnr)
  vim.lsp.buf.format({
    filter = function(client)
      local name = client.name
      return name == "null-ls" or name == "astro"
    end,
    bufnr = bufnr,
  })
end
```

I'm still curious why formatting doesn't work even after including `astro` filetype for Prettierd. But whether I use `null-ls` or the Astro LSP server, it was a one-line change to get the formatter working.
