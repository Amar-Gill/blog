## TLDR

1. Use server prepare module
2. Use this code (link)

## Drizzle ORM

Drizzle is a TypeScript ORM that can also manage migrations for you. During development it's convenient to use their db push feature. When you are ready to go to production, you can generate migration scripts with drizzle-kit.

It would be nice to have your generated migrations be applied automatically when you push code up for a new deployment, instead of copying the SQL scripts and applying them manually.

We will cover two methods to achieve this.

## Architecture

This will work for a Nuxt3 application deployed to Vercel or similar hosting provider with Github integration.

This is meant to be used with a hosted database provider. In this example we are leveraging Turso. Should work the same for other hosted database providers such as PlanetScale or Neon.

## Method 1: Nuxt Build Hooks

Nuxt3 has a powerful system of hooks, that we can levarage to execute the migrations. We will use the `build:before` hook because the migration should run before the new version of the application gets deployed.

We can add handlers for hooks in the `nuxt.config.ts` file:

```ts
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql';
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql/migrator';
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client';
import consola from 'consola';

export default defineNuxtConfig({
  devtools: { enabled: true },
  runtimeConfig: {
    tursoDbUrl: 'file:./server/sqlite.db',
    tursoDbToken: '',
  },
  hooks: {
    async 'build:before'() {
      if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
        console.info('Skipping migrations in dev mode');
        console.info('Run db:push script to update db');
        return;
      }

      console.info('Migrating database...');

      const client = createClient({
        url: process.env.NUXT_TURSO_DB_URL as string,
        authToken: process.env.NUXT_TURSO_DB_TOKEN,
      });

      const db = drizzle(client);

      await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: './migrations' })
        .then(() => consola.info('Database migrated'))
        .catch((err) => {
          console.error('%s', err);
          process.exit(1);
        });
    },
  },
});

```

Things to note:
- as this handler runs before Nuxt is initialized, we access our Turso environment variables through `process.env` instead of `runtimeConfig`
- we exit the handler early during development and instead rely on db push to apply schema changes to the databse
- make sure to use the same migrations folder that you specify in `drizzle.config.ts` file

## Method 2: Server Prepare Nuxt Module

In the second method, we will levarage the handy server-prepare module instead of our own build hook handler.

The code is identical to the code used in the hook, except that we return an empty object to satisfy the return type of the prepare handler.

```ts
import { defineNuxtPrepareHandler } from 'nuxt-prepare/config';
import { drizzle } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql';
import { migrate } from 'drizzle-orm/libsql/migrator';
import { createClient } from '@libsql/client';
import consola from 'consola';

export default defineNuxtPrepareHandler(async () => {
  if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
    consola.box(
      'Skipping migrations in dev mode.\n\n
      Run `db:push` script to use latest schema.'
    );
    return {};
  }

  console.info('Migrating database...');

  const client = createClient({
    url: process.env.NUXT_TURSO_DB_URL as string,
    authToken: process.env.NUXT_TURSO_DB_TOKEN,
  });

  const db = drizzle(client);

  await migrate(db, { migrationsFolder: './migrations' })
    .then(() => consola.success('Database migrated'))
    .catch((err) => {
      console.error('%s', err);
      process.exit(1);
    });

  return {};
});

```
