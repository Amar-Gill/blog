#### intro
this is my zsh configuration for web development, going into the new year!

#### zshrc
- my current theme is [p10k]()
- summary of configs in a list TODO
  - some of the options are:
    - minimal theme
    - less icons
    - sparingly show project contexts: i.e. node env, python env, go version
- .p10k.zsh changes in diff view
  - git formatter TODO this is super cool!!!
  - colors

TODO photo of CLI in different projects (Go, Node, Python)

#### zshenv
- LSCOLORS
- PATH

#### zsh_completion
- link those other articles
- link zsh docs. sourceforge?

####  minimal and fast

I decided to not install a preconfigured framework and roll my own zsh env. The motivation behind this was to minimize shell start up time. Although the framework did contribute to a longer start up, the largest culprit was invoking the NVM initialization during each new session.

On MACHINE I reduced the time from up to 2 seconds down to 200 ms. a 90% decrease, which I am quite pleased with.

#### lazy loading
- kubectl
- nvm
- conda

#### aliases
- git
- colors
- ls
- v
