####  minimal and fast
2023 has just begun, so I'd like to share some features of my zsh configuration. Until recently, I was using oh-my-zsh as a plug in manager.

I decided to not install a preconfigured framework and roll my own zsh config. The primary motivation behind this was to minimize shell start up time, but I also wanted to have total control over my environment and not have too much magic happening behind the scenes.

Although the framework did contribute to a longer start up, the largest culprit was invoking the NVM initialization during each new session.

On my machine I reduced the time from up to 2 seconds down to 200 ms. A 90% decrease, which I am quite pleased with.

Here is a the directory structure as of writing this post:

```bash
zsh
├── p10k.zsh
├── zsh_aliases
├── zsh_completion
├── zshenv
└── zshrc
````
#### zshrc
- my current theme is [p10k]()
- summary of configs in a list TODO
  - some of the options are:
    - minimal theme
    - less icons
    - sparingly show project contexts: i.e. node env, python env, go version
- .p10k.zsh changes in diff view
  - git formatter TODO this is super cool!!!
  - colors

TODO photo of CLI in different projects (Go, Node, Python)
